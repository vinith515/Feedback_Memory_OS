# Feedback Memory OS
> *"Your customers change. Your feedback memory shouldn't."*

**Feedback Memory OS** is an AI-powered customer feedback intelligence platform that continuously ingests feedback from multiple sources, remembers it using **Hindsight** (by Vectorize), discovers evolving customer themes, connects feedback to product decisions, and learns from what happens afterward.

Built for the **AI Hackathon powered by Hindsight (Vectorize)**.

## 1. The Problem
Product teams receive customer feedback from many disconnected sources: support tickets, customer interviews, app reviews, survey responses, and sales calls.
The problem is not simply "too much feedback."

The deeper problem is: **Companies forget context.**
- **Month 1:** Customers complain: *"The onboarding process is confusing."*
- **Month 2:** The company improves onboarding navigation.
- **Month 3:** A different group of customers complains: *"The new onboarding is too long."*
- **Month 4:** Enterprise customers say: *"We actually like the detailed onboarding, but API setup requires 3 engineers."*

A conventional AI summarizer produces four separate, disconnected summaries.
A memory-powered system understands:
- These comments are related across time.
- The product team already attempted a solution.
- The solution resolved SMB friction (+85% CSAT) but exposed a deeper enterprise integration bottleneck.
- Customer sentiment evolved from general UI confusion to specialized API configuration.
- Historical context is essential before deciding what to build next.

## 2. The Solution: Feedback Memory OS
Feedback Memory OS turns fragmented customer feedback into persistent, structured organizational memory. It bridges:
`Customer Feedback Event` ➔ `Problem Detection` ➔ `Product Decision / Intervention` ➔ `Subsequent Feedback` ➔ `Outcome Tracking & Segment Learning`

## 3. Why Memory Matters
| Without Memory (Stateless AI) | With Feedback Memory OS (Hindsight) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Sees only the latest batch of comments in isolation. | Reasons across 12 months of accumulated experience. |
| Recommends repeating solutions you already tried. | Remembers previous product launches and their outcomes. |
| Confused by conflicting feedback across customer tiers. | Discovers segment divergences (Enterprise vs SMB). |
| Treats every complaint as brand new. | Traces opinion shifts and explains the underlying rationale. |

---

## 4. Why Hindsight by Vectorize?
Hindsight is not treated as a hidden database or generic vector store. It is the central biomimetic memory engine:
- **`retain()`**: Ingests raw feedback and product decisions with temporal timestamps and soft dimensional tags (`segment:enterprise`, `source:support`, `theme:onboarding`).
- **`recall()`**: Multi-strategy search combining BM25 keyword matching, semantic vector search, entity graph traversal, and temporal reranking.
- **`reflect()`**: Multi-hop historical reasoning across stored experiences, world facts, and observations.
- **Logical Memory Hierarchy**: Distinguishes **Experiences** (individual tickets & decisions), **World Facts** (customer tiers & products), and **Observations** (consolidated macro patterns).
- **Hard Tenant Isolation**: Discrete Hindsight memory banks guarantee zero cross-company memory leakage.

## 7. The Workflow
1. **0–15s:** Open Dashboard; state the core thesis: *"Companies don't suffer from too much feedback. They suffer from forgetting context."*
2. **15–35s:** Click **"What Changed?"** &rarr; Observe the 7-step chronological memory evolution of the Onboarding friction.
3. **35–55s:** Click **Decision Memory** &rarr; Select `Launch Guided Onboarding V1` &rarr; See before (35 complaints) and after (69 complaints) metrics showing SMB resolution alongside enterprise API divergence.
4. **55–75s:** Click **Memory vs No-Memory** &rarr; Run side-by-side comparison showing stateless AI giving generic advice vs Hindsight agent pinpointing Enterprise API & SSO configuration.
